1-Deploy an app where users can interact with the src/Counter.sol. Use only https://wagmi.sh/ for all web3 interactions.  
2-We should be able to interact with the setMyNumber() and setNumber() on UI.
3-Display myNumber for the connected wallet.   
4-Display number.  
5-Display error message in case of unauthorized usage of setNumber()  
6-The final Github repo and preview deployment of the app should be shared in private to us directly.

Do not use any external APIs or backend. Everything should be done on Frontend.
